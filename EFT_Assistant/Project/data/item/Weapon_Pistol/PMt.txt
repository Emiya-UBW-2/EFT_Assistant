Information_Eng=A semi-mythical Makarov pistol with an extended threaded barrel for equipping a sound suppressor. Some claim it was a limited production series manufactured in Bulgaria, whilst others insist on it being East German, or even a handcrafted upgrade. As for how it ended up in the Norvinsk region, no living soul could tell you now.
