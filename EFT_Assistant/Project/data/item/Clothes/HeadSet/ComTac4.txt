Information_Eng=The ComTac IV Hybrid Communication Headset is designed to help reduce exposure to hazardous levels of noise, improve situational awareness and at the same time enable two-way radio communication in noisy environments. The headset's electronics are contained completely inside the headset housing, eliminating the need for a large, heavy external radio control box. The headband mechanically stabilizes the headset to help relieve issues of earplugs dislodging from cable snags and body movement. Designed for comfortable use with a ballistic helmet.
