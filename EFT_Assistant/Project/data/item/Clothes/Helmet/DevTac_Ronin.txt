Name=DevTac Ronin ballistic helmet
ShortName=Ronin
Information_Eng=A Japan-styled tactical helmet, manufactured by DevTac. Not used by any military or special forces. Just somehow happened to be in Tarkov for some frivolous price. Features a full protection of the whole head, but the armor class is not good enough to actually be useful in combat.
