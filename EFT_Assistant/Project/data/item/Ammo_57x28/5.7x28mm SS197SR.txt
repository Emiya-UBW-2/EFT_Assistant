Information_Eng=A 5.7x28mm FN SS197SR cartridge with a 2.6 gram lead core polymer tipped expansive bullet with a copper metal jacket, in a brass case. This bullet features a ballistic tip that acts as a wedge on the lead core upon impact, allowing the bullet to expand and cause significant damage on the target, and despite the peculiarity of its design and its low speed compared to other cartridges of its caliber, it is able to pierce basic ballistic body protections.
