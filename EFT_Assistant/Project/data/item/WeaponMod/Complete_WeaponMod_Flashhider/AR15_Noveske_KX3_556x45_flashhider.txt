Information_Eng=The Noveske KX3 Flash hider, aka the Burning Pig, is designed to increase reliability in short-barreled members of AR-15 family by increasing backpressure and directing the muzzle blast forward of the shooter. Although originally designed for short-barreled AR-15s, it will work on any barrel length and have since been introduced for a variety of mounts. This particular KX3 may be used on 5.56mm barrels with 1/2x28 threading.
