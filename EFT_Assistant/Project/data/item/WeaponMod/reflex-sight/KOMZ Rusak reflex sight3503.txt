Name=KOMZ Rusak reflex sight
ShortName=Rusak
Information_Eng=A collimator sight manufactured by Kazan Optical-Mechanical Plant in the mid-90s for use on hunting weapons. Installed on the Dovetail type rail, adjustment only possible after full disassembly. Heavy, uncomfortable, foggy sight with horrible parallax - a real product of its time. However, it's still slightly more effective than shooting with iron sights.
