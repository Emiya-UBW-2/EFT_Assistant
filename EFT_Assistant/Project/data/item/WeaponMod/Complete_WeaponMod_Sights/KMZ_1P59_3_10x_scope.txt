Name=KMZ 1P59 3-10x riflescope
ShortName=1P59
Information_Eng=The 1P59 "Giperon" pancratic sight is designed to increase the effectiveness of firing from SVD in comparison with the standard PSO-1 sight by 1.3-2 times (depending on the range and size of the target) due to a larger zoom, the use of a more accurate range finder, combining target ranging and sighting angle input operations, as well as the sighting angle input scale incorporated within the field of view of the sight.
