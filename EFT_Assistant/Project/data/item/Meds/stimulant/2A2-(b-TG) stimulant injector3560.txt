Name=2A2-(b-TG) stimulant injector
ShortName=2A2-(b-TG)
Information_Eng=TerraGroup's next development after the 3-(b-TG) stimulant. The goal of the project was to obtain a drug that would give an advantage in reconnaissance and crossing combat zones far away from supply points. At the same time, the drug is required to be manufacturable in handicraft conditions. The obtained substance allows to keep the CNS in tone for a long period of time, which positively affects the fighter's efficiency to assess the environment, and also enhances their ability to carry equipment. The stimulant’s effective duration is accompanied by increased loss of hydration.
