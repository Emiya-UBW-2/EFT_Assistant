Information_Eng=A .45 ACP (11.43x23mm) Hydra-Shok cartridge with a 14.9 gram lead center-post hollow-point bullet with a copper semi-jacket, in a brass case. Despite having a slightly lower muzzle velocity for its caliber, this cartridge provides one of the best energy transference of the .45 ACP caliber, and can cause severe adverse effects on the target after impact, offering an outstanding stopping power effect at the cost of penetration capabilities.
