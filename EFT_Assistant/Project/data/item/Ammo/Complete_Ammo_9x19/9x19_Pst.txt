Information_Eng=A 9x19mm Parabellum Pst gzh (RG057, GRAU Index - 7N21) cartridge with a 5.4 gram heat-strengthened steel core bullet with two-layer semi-jacket, a polyethylene interior and a bimetallic exterior, in a bimetallic case. This modified PS cartridge (Púlya Stal'náya - "Steel Bullet") was developed by TsNIITochMash in the early 1990s based on the 9x21mm PS gzh "SP10" cartridge to increase the penetration capabilities of Russian 9x19mm weapons against basic body ballistic protections from up to 50 meters, in addition to providing better muzzle velocity.
