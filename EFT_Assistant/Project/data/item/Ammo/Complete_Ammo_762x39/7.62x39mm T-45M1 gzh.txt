Information_Eng=A 7.62x39mm T-45M1 gzh (GAU Index - 57-T-231PM1) cartridge with a 7.6 gram lead core tracer bullet with a bimetallic jacket, in a bimetallic case; intended for target designation and fire adjustment in battle (Trace color: Red). This tracer cartridge is an upgraded version of the T-45 model (GAU Index - 57-T-231), as it provides longer distance tracing capabilities. And despite the rudimentary design of the bullet, it can pierce through basic ballistic body protections as well as some intermediate models in addition to provide a considerable stopping power effect, however, it has a high bounce probability off various surfaces.
