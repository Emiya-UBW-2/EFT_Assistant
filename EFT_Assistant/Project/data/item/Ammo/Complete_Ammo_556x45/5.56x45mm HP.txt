Information_Eng=A .223 Remington (5.56x45mm) HP cartridge with a 3.6 gram lead core hollow-point bullet with a bimetallic jacket in a steel case; intended for hunting, home defense, and target practice. Despite not having the full energy of an intermediate cartridge, the bullet has a considerable stopping power effect as well as being able to cause substantial adverse effects on the target after impact, at the cost of penetration capabilities, even against basic ballistic protection.
