The LPS cartridge (Lyógkaya Púlya so Stal'ným serdéchnikom - "Light Steel core Bullet") was introduced into service in 1953 for Soviet 7.62x54mm R caliber weaponry, and over the years has undergone numerous changes in the materials used for its construction. Thanks to its steel core, it is capable of piercing through basic and intermediate ballistic body protections in addition to providing a considerable stopping power effect, however, it has a high bounce probability off various surfaces.
