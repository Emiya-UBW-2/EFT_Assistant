Information_Eng=A .300 Blackout (7.62x35mm) AP cartridge loaded with an 8.4 gram armor-piercing bullet from a 7.62x51mm NATO M80A1 cartridge, composed of a steel penetrator tip over a copper alloy core with a copper semi-jacket in a brass case. Despite the bullet's own characteristics when used in a full-power cartridge, these are affected when transferred to an intermediate cartridge, however, the bullet continues to have capabilities to pierce basic and intermediate body ballistic protections, in addition to being able to cause substantial adverse effects on the target after impact. Its design also allows it to be used in STANAG 5.56x45mm NATO magazines without any issues.
