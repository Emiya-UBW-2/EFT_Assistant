Information_Eng=A 9x18mm Makarov PBM gzh (GRAU Index - 7N25) cartridge with a 3.7 gram hardened carbon steel core armor-piercing bullet with a bimetallic semi-jacket in a bimetallic case. This cartridge was designed in the 1990s to increase the penetration capabilities of 9x18 mm PM caliber weapons, and thanks to its high muzzle velocity it is capable of piercing through basic ballistic body protection equipment as well as certain intermediate protection equipment at short distances at the cost of a small increase in recoil.
