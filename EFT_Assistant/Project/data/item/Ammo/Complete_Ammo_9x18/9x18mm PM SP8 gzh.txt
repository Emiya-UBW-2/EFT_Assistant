Information_Eng=A 9x18mm Makarov SP8 gzh cartridge with a 3.9 gram frangible hollow-point bullet with a lead core in a plastic plug with a brass semi-jacket, in a bimetallic case with a reduced charge. Developed in the mid-1980s by TsNIITochMash in order to provide a low penetration cartridge to minimize the destruction and over-piercing of objects with low structural strength (for example, during counter-terrorism operations in an aircraft) and still provide a considerable stopping power effect as well as causing substantial adverse effects on the target after impact.
