Information_Eng=A 7.62x51mm NATO M80 cartridge with a 9.5 gram lead-antimony alloy core bullet with a bimetallic jacket, in a brass case. This cartridge was adopted in the United States Armed Forces as a replacement for the 7.62x51mm NATO M59 cartridge after the Vietnam War as standard ammunition, as it provides a considerable stopping power effect as well as being able to pierce through basic and intermediate body ballistic protections. However, it has a high bounce probability on various surfaces.
