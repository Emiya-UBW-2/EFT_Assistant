Information_Eng=G36 is a 5.56x45mm assault rifle designed in the early 1990s by German company Heckler & Koch as a replacement for the heavier 7.62x51mm G3 battle rifle. It was accepted into service with the Bundeswehr in 1997, replacing the G3. Since then, it has also been a popular export, and the G36 has seen active service in military and police units in several countries, including Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom.
