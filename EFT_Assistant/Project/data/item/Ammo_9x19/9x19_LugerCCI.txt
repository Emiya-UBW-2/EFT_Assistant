Information_Eng=A 9x19mm Luger cartridge with a special heavy bullet; marked with a blue tip, manufactured by CCI. Despite the heavy bullet on this cartridge, it still has an average muzzle velocity relative to other cartridges of the same caliber, endowing it with a considerable stopping power effect, along with causing severe adverse effects on the target after impact at the cost of penetration capabilities.
