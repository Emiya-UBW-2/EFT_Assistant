Information_Eng=The PP-91 Kedr is a submachine gun chambered in 9x18 PM, designed by Yevgeny Dragunov in the early 90s by order of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and produced at ZMZ (Zlatoústovskiy Mashinostroítelnyy Zavód - "Zlatoust Machine-Building Plant"). This submachine gun has a simple but effective design. Its light weight makes it more comfortable to carry without affecting its performance, and it provides a high rate of fire without affecting its recoil. Thanks to these characteristics, it's still used as a service weapon in almost all Russian law enforcement agencies.
