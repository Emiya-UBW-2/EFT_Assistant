Information_Eng=The SR-25 Precision Rifle is the latest evolution of the precision 7.62mm NATO semi-automatic rifle. An ambidextrous bolt release, selector, and magazine release offers the left-handed user the ergonomic advantages inherent to AR-15 based controls, as well as giving right-handed users alternate methods of manipulation to increase efficiency of movement. The Drop-In 2-Stage Trigger serves as an aid to long range precision marksmanship. The E2 bolt and gas system provides superior reliability in function whether suppressed or unsuppressed.
